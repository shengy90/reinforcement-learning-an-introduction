        "> `Rewards` are in a sense *primary* whereas `values`, as predictions of rewards, are secondary. Without reward there can be no value. The only purpose of estimating `values` is to achieve more `reward`. Nevertheless, we're concerned with value when making and evaluating decisions, because we care about getting the greatest rewards over the long run. **Unfortunately, values are hard to detarmine; it must be estimated and re-estimated from the sequences of observations an agent makes over its lifetime**.\n",
